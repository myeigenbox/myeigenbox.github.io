What ever you do these days on the internet we are constantly monitored and surveilled. We are not even asked. If you use a service for some time sooner or later you will get a notice that the
business rules have changed. They ask you for consent. But actually you have no choice. All you can do is to bend over and drop your pants. Do you realize that Google can read each and every
email you send and receive via GMail. And they not only can do it, they actually do it! Now you understand why the NSA wants to have access to Google's server farm. Unless you encrypt your files
using Dropbox all your data is unsecure. The only solution is to run your own box where only you have physical access to. Up to now it was too cumbersome and too expensive to do that. We want to
change that. In the first phase we use MyEigenBox for hosting files. You have access to all your files over the internet absolutely in a safe fashion. Welcome to your private cloud.
